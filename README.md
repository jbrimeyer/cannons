##Development

Our gravity based game is a borrowed theme from my classmates and friends at Northwestern University's Full Stack Web Development Program. I felt their Cannon-Ball Game (add link to their github repo)  is a perfect way to educate and involve students in learning about gravity while at the observatory. Our version does not use any of the technologies used in my classmates version because I wanted the challenge of learning new technologies and to build this exhibit from scratch.
